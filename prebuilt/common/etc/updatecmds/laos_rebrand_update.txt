## This file allows data retention from CM -> LAOS by exploiting
## the updatecmds mechanism within installd. 

# Example:

#Declare the source:target package
#then list the directory which need to retained across
#an upgrade.
org.cyanogenmod.launcher:org.lineageos.launcher
    databases
    files
    shared_prefs

#Due to source and target equivelance not being checked by installd
#this may work for retaining data across signature changes as well
#without having a rename
